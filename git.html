# Git basics and vocabulary

---

- **diff**: the difference between 2 files
- **commit**: a set of diffs
- **branch**: a sequence of commits
- **repo**: a set of branches

---

- **diff**: the difference between 2 files
- **commit**:
  - a set of diffs
  - *metadata*:
    - the commit message
    - the author name and email
    - the commit's parent
- **branch**:
  - a sequence of commits
  - not necessarly just a straight sequence
- **repo**: a set of branches


---

# other important concepts

---

In your local repo

- **staging**: the things that will get added in the next commit
- **remote**: a remote repo. You can add more than one

---
# Collaboration models

---

The __"Github"__ model

Commonly used in public github projects.

Mostly interesting as a method of access control: allows you to easily accept code from untrusted sources.

- my local repo
- my remote repo
- the central remote repo

When your branch is ready:

- push from your local repo to *your* remote repo
- make a PR from *your* remote to the public remote
---

![trinity](./holy_trinity_model.jpg)
---

The __"Trust everyone"__ model

Trust everyone. Simpler. More likely to be used if using git at a company.

- my local repo
- the central remote repo
---

![shared](./shared_central_repo_model.jpg "shared")
---

# Day to Day Git

---

## Note: this is what I consider best practice. Opinions may vary.

---

# Starting

new local repo:

```bash
git init
```

clone a remote repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/robot/robot-framework.git
```

---

Create a branch to work in:

```bash
git checkout -b sampti_fix_input_text_xpath origin/master
```

---

# "What is currently happening" comands
---

```bash
git status
```

 - what is the state of my local repo
 - what will go into the next commit ("staged")
 - what file are changed but will not go into the next commit
 - what files are new (and not gitignored)
---
```bash
git branch
```

- what branch am I on
- what other branches are in my local repo
---
```bash
git log
```

- what has happened so far on this branch
- what branch is this branch based on

---

# Commiting changes

1. edit
2. `git add`
3. `git commit`
4. goto 1

---
# Pro-tip: just take **parts** of a file
---
Many git commands that accept files, also take a "-p" flag.

"-p" = don't add the whole file, but instead, interactively let me choose which parts of the file are added

1. edit
    1. `git add -p`
    2. `git commit`
    3.  repeat as needed
2. goto 1

---

# Undoing work that something you didn't mean to change

---

# Undoing a something from the filesystem

```bash
git checkout -- [filepath]
```

reset the currently unstaged file to the state is in the most recent commit

that change is still (probably) on disk.
---
*better version:*

```bash
git checkout -p```

---

# Undoing a staged change

```bash
git reset HEAD -- [filepath]
```

"unstage" the changes for the file

i.e. the changes are still there, they just won't go into the next commit
---
```bash
git reset -p
```

= ask me diff by diff

---

# pushing changes "upstream"

note: "HEAD"=branch that I'm currently on

```bash
git push origin HEAD```
---
or, push local branch `test_improvements_bugfix` to remote `test_improvements`

```bash
git push origin test_improvement_bugfix:test_improvements```
---
or overwrite the remote `test_improvements` with local `test_improvements`

```bash
git push -f origin test_improvements```

---

# Get upstream changes from repo

Get all the changes on all branches from the repo origin

```bash
git fetch origin```

---

# Getting remote changes into your branch
---

## Rebase vs Merge

---

![yoda](./yoda.jpg)
---
TL/DR: just rebase

---

Longer answer: rebase except in some circumstances

---

what are rebase and merge?

---

# rebase

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/master
```
---
basically:
give me a branch with my local work ontop of the latest version of origin/master
---
Roughly what happens:
- create a new branch from origin/master
- apply my local work (i.e. the new commits) from my local branch ontop of that
- clobber my old local branch with this new branch
---
the old branch and the new branch cannot be connected anymore
- makes it look like your starting point was origin/master as it currently is
- history has changed
- when you push it needs to be a force push

---

# Why is rebase better?

it leaves the history cleaner. That makes:

- code review
- future debugging of when-was-this-bug-introduced

**much** simpler

---
Note: I'd say most people agree with me, but there are some heretics that don't

Follow the rules of the project you're in. Ask if you're unsure

---

# When to not rebase

Rebasing rewrites git history i.e. it "destroys" the old branch.

Therefore others working in the same branch can no longer connect their changes into your shared branch anymore.

Basically, any time you do a "force push" you screw over anyone who is working in the same remote branch as you
---
However:

Having multiple people working in feature branches is not a good idea.

Basically: one author per branch

(note: never push directly to master, especially force push)

---

# Merge

- Doesn't rewrite history
- Does leave history looking like a mess
- Makes git bisecting/finding bugs later painful
- "time flows forwards and backwards"

---

# Interactive rebasing

---

## "make me look like I never make mistakes"

---

# history is not immutable in git
---
you can (and in certain cases **should**) change (**private**) history

might sound a little odd if you're used to other source control systems

---

## Changing *private* history let's you make your changes much more understandable

---

##It decouples the "learning" part of coding from the "telling a story" part.

The _story_ is much easier to read if is linear and nicely organised
---
Usually you don't necessarily know exactly what needs to be done when you start a coding task.

Git lets you:

1. figure it all out/get it working
1. split and rearrange the necessary changes so that history reads like you knew exactly what you were doing right from the start
1. remove any "fix bug I made earlier" commits

---

You can and should do this.

- makes it much nicer to review if commits are small and logically self-contained
- makes it much nicer if you need to go back and figure out why/when something broke

*important note* you can't do this if anyone else is sharing your branch

---

If you just want to change the most recent commit i.e. "damn, I forgot to add that file" (or whatever):

```bash
git add blah.py
git commit --amend
```

---

changing older commits:

```bash
git add blah.py
git commit --fixup=commit_hash_of_commit_you_want_to_fix
[git stash]
git rebase --interactive --autosquash origin/master
edit git log
[git stash pop]
```

---

# Git stash

- `git stash`: move changes away for a bit (kinda like an anonymous branch)
- `git stash pop`: bring them back

---
# Workflows
---
# Basic workflow

1. get new code from the server
2. create a branch for your work
3. edit/add/commit loop
4. publish changes
5. create pull request
6. verify that tests pass
7. get approval from a colleague
8. merge
9. goto 1
---
# More advanced workflow
---
1. get new code from the server
2. create a branch for your work
3. edit/add/commit loop
4. cleanup up branch history via interactive rebasing
4. publish changes
5. create pull request
6. verify that tests pass
7. get approval from a colleague
    1. fix comments from colleague
    2. cleanup branch history
    3. force push new changes
    4. verify that CI tests pass
8. merge
9. goto 1

# Tools

---

# GUI tools

---

**mac**: gitup (pretty nice)

**others**: gitkraken (never used but heard it's nice)

---

# Command line tools

---

- tig
- git config
- shell (bash, zsh, whatever) config to show branch and repo state in prompt

---

# Git config

---

You can make the bare git client much nicer with some configuration
